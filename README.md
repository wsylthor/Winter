<h3>📌 About Me</h3>
I've had my fair share of experience with Luau, javascript, python, assembly and C#. At this current time, my main focus has been on system security.<br/><br/>
I like to view things from different perspectives, for example reverse engineering ideas and utilizing technology. Most of my work is proprietary and falls under passion projects, but I'm still happy to discuss it through my socials.
